	title = {Exploratory Gradient Boosting for Reinforcement Learning in Complex Domains},
	abstract = {High-dimensional observations and complex realworld dynamics present major challenges in reinforcement learning for both function approximation and exploration. We address both of these challenges with two complementary techniques: First, we develop a gradient-boosting style, nonparametric function approximator for learning on Q-function residuals. And second, we propose an exploration strategy inspired by the principles of state abstraction and information acquisition under uncertainty. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of these techniques, ﬁrst, as a preliminary check, on two standard tasks (Blackjack and n-Chain), and then on two much larger and more realistic tasks with high-dimensional observation spaces. Speciﬁcally, we introduce two benchmarks built within the game Minecraft where the observations are pixel arrays of the agent’s visual ﬁeld. A combination of our two algorithmic techniques performs competitively on the standard reinforcementlearning tasks while consistently and substantially outperforming baselines on the two tasks with highdimensional observation spaces. The new function approximator, exploration strategy, and evaluation benchmarks are each of independent interest in the pursuit of reinforcement-learning methods that scale to real-world domains.},

We designed and implemented four different ensemble methods combining ﬁve different reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-learning, Sarsa, Actor-Critic, {QV}-learning, and {ACLA}. The intuitively designed ensemble methods: majority voting, rank voting, Boltzmann multiplication, and Boltzmann addition, combine the policies derived from the value functions of the different {RL} algorithms, in contrast to previous work where ensemble methods have been used in {RL} for representing and learning a single value function. We show experiments on ﬁve maze problems of varying complexity, the ﬁrst problem is simple, but the other four maze tasks are of a dynamic or partially observable nature.

	title = {Tree-Based Batch Mode Reinforcement Learning},
	abstract = {Reinforcement learning aims to determine an optimal control policy from interaction with a system or from observations gathered from a system. In batch mode, it can be achieved by approximating the so-called Q-function based on a set of four-tuples (xt , ut , rt , xt+1) where xt denotes the system state at time t, ut the control action taken, rt the instantaneous reward obtained and xt+1 the successor state of the system, and by determining the control policy from this Q-function. The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods ({CART}, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.},

	abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an offpolicy actor-critic deep {RL} algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep {RL} methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

	abstract = {We introduce new estimators for robust machine learning based on median-of-means ({MOM}) estimators of the mean of real valued random variables. These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence under minimal assumptions on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard tools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of breakdown point. We modify the original deﬁnition by studying the number of outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that takes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of number of observations * rate of convergence. For instance, the breakdown number of our estimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise variance σ2 is σ2d and it becomes σ2s log(ed/s) when this vector has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is number of outliers divided by number of observations.},

	title = {Never Give Up: Learning Directed Exploration Strategies},
	abstract = {We propose a reinforcement learning agent to solve hard exploration games by learning a range of directed exploratory policies. We construct an episodic memory-based intrinsic reward using k-nearest neighbors over the agent's recent experience to train the directed exploratory policies, thereby encouraging the agent to repeatedly revisit all states in its environment. A self-supervised inverse dynamics model is used to train the embeddings of the nearest neighbour lookup, biasing the novelty signal towards what the agent can control. We employ the framework of Universal Value Function Approximators to simultaneously learn many directed exploration policies with the same neural network, with different trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. By using the same neural network for different degrees of exploration/exploitation, transfer is demonstrated from predominantly exploratory policies yielding effective exploitative policies. The proposed method can be incorporated to run with modern distributed {RL} agents that collect large amounts of experience from many actors running in parallel on separate environment instances. Our method doubles the performance of the base agent in all hard exploration in the Atari-57 suite while maintaining a very high score across the remaining games, obtaining a median human normalised score of 1344.0\%. Notably, the proposed method is the first algorithm to achieve non-zero rewards (with a mean score of 8,400) in the game of Pitfall! without using demonstrations or hand-crafted features.},

While being accessible and flexible, natural language instructions can sometimes be ambiguous even to humans. To address this, we propose to utilize programs, structured in a formal language, as a precise and expressive way to specify tasks. We then devise a modular framework that learns to perform a task specified by a program – as different circumstances give rise to diverse ways to accomplish the task, our framework can perceive which circumstance it is currently under, and instruct a multitask policy accordingly to fulfill each subtask of the overall task. Experimental results on a 2D Minecraft environment not only demonstrate that the proposed framework learns to reliably accomplish program instructions and achieves zero-shot generalization to more complex instructions but also verify the efficiency of the proposed modulation mechanism for learning the multitask policy. We also conduct an analysis comparing various models which learn from programs and natural language instructions in an end-to-end fashion.},

The volume of charged energy at charging units is considered as a variable in the objective function to determine the location of charging units at minimum cost. The model was veriﬁed by a case study based on actual bus service data.

Encouraged by the urgent need for cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, vehicle electriﬁcation has been advancing at an unprecedented pace.

Battery Electric Bus ({BEB}), with superior features such as zero-emission and reduced noise, is made ready for commercial deployment in the past several years. However, it is still a grand challenge to successfully deploy {BEB} system given the nature of the public transit system and the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of {BEB}. This research presents a bi-objective optimization model for {BEB} deployment to consider constraints unique to the {BEB} system and to address the trade-off between environmental equity for the disadvantaged population and capital investment. The model is further demonstrated using the transit system operated by the Utah Transit Authority ({UTA}) to offer insights on the beneﬁts gained as a result of {BEB} deployment. Optimal deployment plans under different budgets are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The trade-offs in each of the plans are further discussed and compared. This research set the foundation for transit agencies to develop optimal deployment strategies for {BEB} systems when multiple goals need to be considered, allowing planners and decision-makers to create a transportation ecosystem that better serves livable and sustainable communities.

In this paper, we simulated daily charging patterns and demand charges of a ﬂeet of electric buses in Tallahassee, Florida and identiﬁed an optimal charging strategy to minimize demand charges. It was found that by using a charging threshold of 60–64\%, a \$160,848 total saving in electricity cost can be achieved for a ﬁve electric bus ﬂeet, comparing to a charging threshold of 0–28\%. In addition, the impact of ﬂeet sizes on the fuel cost was investigated. Fleets of 4 and 12 buses will achieve the lowest cost per mile driven when one fast charger is installed.},

	abstract = {The paradigm shift in adopting electriﬁed public transportation, enabled by long-range battery electric buses ({BEBs}) and associated charging infrastructure, inﬂict operational challenges to both power distribution and transit systems. This article takes an opportunistic look at the paradigm shift and develops a model for optimally scheduling the spatio-temporal charging ﬂexibility of {BEBs} as a source of operational ﬂexibility for power distribution systems. The proposed model co-optimizes the timing and location of {BEBs}’ charging in the transit system with the operation of the power distribution system, while respecting the operational constraints and requirements of both power distribution and public transit systems. In the proposed model, the {BEBs} transit system is mathematically modeled by a graph and the associated {BEB} charging stations are mapped into the power distribution nodes. The {BEBs}’ transit schedule constrains the spatio-temporal charging opportunities to all {BEBs} over the scheduling horizon. The proposed model is implemented on the {IEEE} 33-bus power distribution system coupled with the transit system of Park City, {UT}, {USA}, with {BEB} routes. The numerical results showcase the economic and operational beneﬁts of the proposed model for the power distribution system operator and transit system operator.},

The ordered charge control strategy proposed in this paper solves the problem of electric bus charging optimization. This strategy enables security and economy to be better guaranteed in the operation of the power system. The orderly control strategy adopts the method of hierarchical control, including the prediction layer, scheduling layer and control layer. In this paper, an optimization model for the rapid charging of electric buses based on the cost of charging and battery loss is first set up. Considering charging power constraint and restraint and power supply limit of departure, according to the data of forecasted layer's expected full load rate, traffic index and timesharing price, the rolling layer is optimized continuously in the dispatching layer, and finally the reliable charging plan is arranged by the dispatching layer. In order to verify the effectiveness of hierarchical charge control strategy, a fast charging station is optimized for charging. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed method has the function of clipping peaks and filling valleys and improves the rapid charging of electric buses of the economy, weakened a large number of electric vehicles focused on the impact of grid power.},

Besides several operational challenges, an appropriate grid integration of battery electric buses ({BEBs}) is crucial to maintain a safe and stable operation of the distribution grid. Increasing charging powers of up to 600 {kW} may complicate the situation further. The objective of this study is to evaluate the grid impacts of three different bus charging methods – Every Station Charging, End Station Charging and Overnight Charging – on a typical urban European distribution grid. Therefore, the charging behavior of an electric bus line was modeled with a time resolution of one second and then connected to a large grid simulation. Multiple scenario modiﬁcations have been discussed, such as increasing the number of electriﬁed bus lines, taking into account photovoltaics, and charging in the {LV} grid instead. Results show that the tested grid is capable of integrating {BEBs} in most situations, while Every Station Charging causes higher simultaneity of charging and larger voltage drops than the other scenarios. Moreover, {LV} charging shows to be unsuitable for high power charging. To conclude, the results of the simulations offer a solid basis for considerations regarding the electriﬁcation of public bus routes.},

In this context, the implementation of urban buses implies the development of new grid infrastructures in order to carry out the electricity supply required by the charging stations. In order to optimize the size of these infrastructures and to have more power capacity, this contribution proposes the design and the sizing of a fast charging station with a stationary energy storage system ({ESS}) installed, to supply the energy of the buses that run on one of the lines of Pamplona (Spain). In this contribution, first, the power demanded by the charging point is measured at the fast charging station located at the Public University of Navarre. Second, three energy management strategies are developed with which to use {ESS}. Finally, the proposed energy management strategies are simulated with the measured data obtained. The results achieved in this contribution show that with a 40 {kWh} {ESS}, the power demanded from the grid can be reduced by a whole 70\%, that is, from 250 {kW} to 74 {kW}. In addition, the power contracted in the electricity rate is reduced too.},

Also, the day-ahead dynamic prices are derived to mitigate charging impacts on power distribution systems. This problem is formulated as a distributionally robust Markov decision process ({DRMDP}) with uncertain transition probabilities and costs to address the impacts of random bus loads with inaccurate probability density function estimation. An event-based ambiguity set with combined statistical distance and moment information is developed to achieve minimax-regret criteria for less-conservative and robust solutions. To facilitate practical applications with reduced computational complexity, a heuristic regret function is proposed, based on which the dynamic prices are derived.

This conversion represents a challenge for the electrical grid due to the increase of the electrical demand. The typical daily timeline for bus routes of the bus depot in Alsterdorf in the city of Hamburg is considered in this paper. This enabled the authors to calculate the daily load profile of this bus depot. Moreover, the authors could identify different potentials to optimize the whole load profile. In order to decrease the peak load, this paper is introducing two new possibilities for the load distribution over the available charging slots; preemptive and quasi-preemptive greedy algorithms.

	abstract = {In this paper, an auto-tuning control system ({ACS}), which utilizes variation of self-inductance of a transmitter (Tx) coil caused by ferrite core of a receiver (Rx), is newly proposed for the dynamic wireless electric vehicle ({EV}) charging. A Tx module consists of only passive elements that include a Tx coil, a partially compensated capacitor in series with the Tx coil, and a parallel compensation capacitor. All Tx modules share an {AC} bus line that pass the output filter of an inverter in parallel without any active switches. The current of the coupled Tx coil increases automatically without any manipulations such as controlling the power switches, sensing, or communication when the Rx module is approaching. Not only the system efficiency is increased by reduction of the conduction losses from uncoupled Tx modules, but control also becomes simpler because sensors are not required for detecting {EVs} and constant output voltage characteristics can be obtained. Through simulations and experiments, it was found that the proposed {ACS} is suitable for applications in which a transportation runs along a track with a small air gap, such as a train or tram. The results showed that the current of a coupled Tx coil increased 11.6 times larger than that of an uncoupled Tx coil, at which time the {DC}-{DC} efficiency achieved was 88.4 \% for an output power of 766 W (10 ohm of load resistance) at the laboratory scale. The measured maximum efficiency was 96.7 \% for 100 ohm of load resistance.},

	abstract = {The transition from diesel–based transit bus systems toward a zero-emission transportation system is a timely-topic that is currently supported by governmental and municipal investments across the globe. Prior research works as well as ongoing demonstration projects in the electriﬁcation of public bus networks prioritize the electriﬁcation of transit buses. In which, there is a gap in the literature in investigating the electriﬁcation of intercity bus systems. Unlike a transit bus service, which has frequent stops throughout a city or town, an intercity i.e., coach bus service generally has a single stop at one location in or near a city, and travels long distances via highway routes. To that end, this paper studies the energy consumption and design of charging stations to power electric intercity buses. The study is conducted for a real-world demonstration project that is planned by Metrolinx, a regional transit system serving the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area ({GTHA}) in Canada, to be deployed by 2019 in the {GO} Bus transit system. The study aims to investigate the double decker ({DD}) battery electric bus ({BEB}) energy consumption; plan for the {BEBs} operation service and charging scheduling; and conduct a cost analysis for the {BEBs} charging based on the wholesale and time of use electricity prices mechanism.},

	title = {A Network Flow Approach to Battery Electric Bus Scheduling},
	abstract = {A major challenge to adopting battery electric buses into bus ﬂeets is the scheduling of the battery charging while considering route timing constraints and battery charge. This work develops a scheduling framework to balance the use of slow and fast chargers assuming the bus routes and charger locations are ﬁxed. Slow chargers are utilized when possible to lower the cost of charging and fast chargers are used when needed to meet timing constraints and to ensure a sufﬁcient charge for route execution. A directed, acyclic graph is used to model the available charge times for buses that periodically return to the station to pick up passengers and to recharge its battery. A constrained network ﬂow Mixed-Integer Linear Program ({MILP}) problem is formulated to optimize the scheduling of chargers as well as to determine the number of chargers required to meet battery state of charge thresholds. Using a randomly generated route schedule for thirty buses, results are presented that demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to ﬁnd optimal charging plans while considering peak time charging costs and allowing for ﬁxed and variable numbers of chargers.},

In this paper, electric vehicles have been categorized as electric buses, electric taxis, electric private cars and electric buses. The probabilistic models of load influencing factors are investigated, and then the calculation models of charging power for different types of electric vehicles have been attained. According to the predicted results of electric vehicle ownership, the charging load of the electric vehicle is calculated by use of Monte Carlo Simulation method for extraction of both electric vehicle initial charging state and charging time. Finally, a deep learning algorithm {LSTM} (Long Short Term Memory) has been utilized to predict the charging load of electric vehicles.

	abstract = {Public transportation, such as buses, depends mostly on fossil fuels, which results in signiﬁcant environmental and health issues, especially for cities with high altitudes. The integration of electric buses ({EBs}) has been carried out as one of the alternatives to electrify public transportation. Although {EBs} will help to overcome these issues, a massive penetration of {EBs} will also lead to several technical issues. Moreover, their challenges compared to typical electric vehicles ({EVs}) are more complex due to the lack of ﬂexibility and temporal correlation of scheduling for public transportation. This paper studies the effect of charging {EBs} in a bus station in the power load, and proposes a new methodology considering {EB} aggregators to minimize electricity costs while meeting grid constraints. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the number of {EB} chargers in the charging costs.},

	abstract = {With the growing popularity of electric vehicles ({EV}), there is an urgent demand to solve the stress placed on grids caused by the irregular and frequent access of {EVs}. The traditional direct current ({DC}) fast charging station ({FCS}) based on a photovoltaic ({PV}) system can effectively alleviate the stress of the grid and carbon emission, but the high cost of the energy storage system ({ESS}) and the under utilization of the grid-connected interlinking converters ({GIC}) are not very well addressed. In this paper, the {DC} {FCS} architecture based on a {PV} system and {ESS}-free is ﬁrst proposed and employed to reduce the cost. Moreover, the proposed smart charging algorithm ({SCA}) can fully coordinate the source/load properties of the grid and {EVs} to achieve the maximum power output of the {PV} system and high utilization rate of {GICs} in the absence of {ESS} support for {FCS}. {SCA} contains a self-regulated algorithm ({SRA}) for {EVs} and a grid-regulated algorithm ({GRA}) for {GICs}. While the {DC} bus voltage change caused by power ﬂuctuations does not exceed the set threshold, {SRA} readjusts the charging power of each {EV} through the status of the charging ({SOC}) feedback of the {EV}, which can ensure the power rebalancing of the {FCS}. The {GRA} would participate in the adjustment process once the {DC} bus voltage is beyond the set threshold range. Under the condition of ensuring the charging power of all {EVs}, a {GRA} based on adaptive droop control can improve the utilization rate of {GICs}. At last, the simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed {SCA}.},
