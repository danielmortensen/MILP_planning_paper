\section{Multi-Graph Additions}
An additional contribution this work offers is the expansion to night vs day charging. During the night, there is one charger for each bus; each with a single charge rate.  During this time, buses are also available to charge at any time.  These differences in operations introduce changes to the original graph formation and warrent a separate graph.  
\par Night graphs consider a situation where both the number of buses reflecte the number of chargers and buses are readily available.  Note how there are several source and sink nodes in figure \ref{fig:nightVsDayGraph}.  When a bus deploys for the day, the available number of charges changes and are reflected in the underlying source and sink constraints.
