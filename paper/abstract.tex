\begin{abstract}
	Recent calls for a reduced carbon footprint have pushed transit authorities to adopt battery electric buses (BEBs). Two challenges BEB users experience are high power demands and extended charge times. Power demands can significantly increase monthly power costs, making BEBs exorbitantly expensive. The extended charge times create logistical difficulties and force BEBs to charge when energy is more expensive.  This work presents a comprehensive framework for minimizing the monthly cost incurred by BEBs while meeting schedule constraints and includes the following contributions: incorporation of uncontrolled loads, operational environments for both day and night charging, multi-rate charging, and a realistic, comprehensive cost model.
