\section{Future Work}
Future work should extend to preserving battery health.  The algorithms presented in this paper were primarily focused on minimizing average power draw and avoiding on-peak time periods.  High instantanious power use, as observed in this work, can reduce the lifespan of the battery.  A battery-centric scenario would lend itself well to a multi-rate charging framework.
\par Additonally, this work included only discrete charge rates.  Future work might generalise to continuous charge selection, and real-time deployment.  Because this work presents a planning framework that gives a global solution for large stretches of time, it it computationally expensive.  During real-time operations, additional work might include algorithms to handle deviations in a stochastic environmnet, where the objective is to get back to the global plan.  
\par The global plan could also be improved by optimising in a more robust manner, where areas of high uncertainty in either bus schedule or uncontrolled loads are generally avoided.
