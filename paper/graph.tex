\section{Graph Info}
1. Describe basic structure
    a. nodes
        i. what this is, and how it relates to the problem.  
	    1. a node represents charging options, 0th is no charge, i,j (i > 0) represents the option to charge bus i at time j.  This can be thought of as some aspect of state (include picture).  Make sure to mention how nodes indicate bus schedule
    b. edges
        i. what this is, and how it relates to the problem.
	    1. an edge represents how a charger gets from one node to the next.  
	    2. Give example of node to node connection and what this means (include picture)
2. Describe represenation
    a. adjacency matrix
3. How this fits in
    a. Associated variables for linear program
    b. How these work with adjacency matrix for flow constraints
    c. How these work with adjacency matrix for group constraints
