\section{Graph Based Problem Formulation}
A solution to the bus charge problem must reveal \textit{what} to charge and \textit{when} to charge it. This implies a two dimensional solution where each axis describes \textit{what} and \textit{when} to charge respectively. The first dimension contains one charge state for each bus and an additional `no-charge' state. The time axis is continuous by nature and is represented discretly by the time indices $t_0,t_1,\hdots,t_n$ 
\par The intersection of each charge state and time index is represented by a node (see figure \ref{fig:graphGridStructure}) where the the $ij^{\text{th}}$ node represents the $i^{\text{th}}$ charge state at the $j^{\text{th}}$ time index. For example, $\text{node}_{1,1}$ of figure \ref{fig:graphGridStructure} represents a state where a charger charges Bus 2 at time index $t_0$. 
\par Note that a complete grid, implies that each charger can charge any bus at any time.  When buses leave the station for routes however, they become unavailable. To reflect the various absenses caused by running routes, charge nodes corresponding to route times must be removed (see figure \ref{fig:busAvailEncode}).

\par Additionally, charge nodes are only valid for small periods of time. As time progresses, chargers must transition from state to state. These state transitions are represented by forming a weighted connection, or edge between two nodes (see figure \ref{fig:edgeNodeRel}). Each edge leaves a previous state and enters a target state. The use of each edge is determined by its weight, which gives the number of chargers using the transition.  Therefore edges by themselves represent \textit{potential} transitions (see figure \ref{fig:completeGraph}), and are made `active' by assigning a non-zero weight.

\par Edges can also be thought of as decisions because they determine the next state for each charger. In the bus charge problem, there are four types of decisions: Connect, Charge, No-Charge, and Disconnect. Connect edges are formed when an edge transitions from a no-charge state to a charge state, charge edges are given by connections from one charge state to another, No-Charge transitions occur between no-charge nodes, and disconnect edges transition from charge to no-charge states (see figure \ref{fig:edgeTypes}).

\par Consider a two-charger scenario where buses follow the schedule given in figure \ref{fig:completeGraph}. A solution where Bus 1 charges from $t_1$ to $t_2$ and Bus 2 charges from $t_4$ to $t_5$ would be expressed by assigning non-zero weights to the appropriate connect, charge, and disconnect edges as shown in figure \ref{fig:graphWithSolution}.  Thus, solving the bus charge problem becomes a matter of finding the optimal set of edge weights.

\par To find the optimal set of weights, the graph must first be encoded in an incidence matrix. An incidence matrix organizes relationships between nodes and edges by describing which edges depart from and connect to which nodes. An incidence matrix $A$ is an nNode $\times$ nEdge matrix where nNode is the number of nodes, and nEdge is the number of edges. 
\par The columns of $A$ describe connections for each edge and the rows give connections for each node. Incoming connections are represented with $1$, outgoing connections with $-1$, and no connection with $0$. For example, the graph in figure \ref{fig:genericGraph} can be represented as:
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}

\par  An incidence matrix can be used to find the number of chargers entering and leaving each state. None of the states (charging/non-charging) can create or destroy chargers and so the number of incoming must always equal the number of outgoing chargers. The only exception occurs at \textit{source} and \textit{sink} nodes.
\par A source node represents the beginning state of all chargers.  Because a source state is the first, there are no incoming edges and hence, the net difference between incoming and outgoing chargers, or \textit{the net-flow}, will be minus the number of chargers. 
\par Sink nodes represent the final state, where all chargers enter and finish (see figure \ref{fig:sourceSink}). Because sinks have no outgoing edges, they maintain a positive net-flow equal to the number of chargers. Let $x$ be a vector representing the edge weights, $A$ be an adjacency matrix, and $f$ be a vector where $f_i$ gives the net-flow for the $i^{\text{th}}$ node. The net-flow for each node can be expressed as 

\begin{figure}

\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Network flow illustrating sources and sinks}
	\label{fig:sourceSink} 
\end{figure} 

\begin{align}
	Ax = f
\end{align}
This expression can be used to constrain the net-flow of each node.  $f$ must equal zero for all non-source and non-sink elements and source/sink nodes must have net-flows equal to $-\text{nChargers}$ and nChargers respectively (see equation \ref{eqn:cFlow}).
\begin{align}\label{eqn:cFlow}
	Ax = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ -\text{nCharger} \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ \text{nCharger} \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

\par Flow can also be used to ensure that buses connect to only one charger at a time. Let a charge session, or \textit{group}, be the set of all charge nodes between routes as shown in figure \ref{fig:groups}. The \textit{group flow} is the number of chargers that enter a group and is computed by adding the weights for all incoming edges (see figure \ref{fig:groupedEdges}). 
\par Let $B$ be a nGroup $\times$ nEdge matrix where the $ij^{\text{th}}$ entry is $1$ if the $j^{\text{th}}$ edge enters the $i^{\text{th}}$ group and $0$ otherwise. For example, the $B$ matrix corresponding to figure \ref{fig:groupEdges} contains $1$ in the $7^{\text{th}}$ and $10^{\text{th}}$ columns for Group 1, and $12^{\text{th}}$ and $15^{\text{th}}$ columns for group 2 as given in equation \ref{eqn:groupB}.
\begin{align}\label{eqn:groupB}
	B = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
	                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}

The group flow is then computed as

	Bx \le \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \\\vdots \\ 1\end{bmatrix},

\section{Multi-Graph Additions}
An additional contribution this work offers is the expansion to night vs day charging. During the night, there is one charger for each bus; each with a single charge rate.  During this time, buses are also available to charge at any time.  These differences in operations introduce changes to the original graph formation and warrent a separate graph.  
\par Night graphs consider a situation where both the number of buses reflecte the number of chargers and buses are readily available.  Note how there are several source and sink nodes in figure \ref{fig:nightVsDayGraph}.  When a bus deploys for the day, the available number of charges changes and are reflected in the underlying source and sink constraints.
