<talk about how graphs relate to the problem at hand, this section talks about graphs because... we use graphs to encode bus availability, and edges to encode different charge rates>
<'this' needs to be more specific>
<the first paragraph is too compressed.  Need to explain things more concisely and define terms before I use them>
<potential order for information: - to be done in another section where we describe the problem formulation
    1. buses (battery, SOC) and routes
    2. station, depot charging, and availability
    3. constraints:
        a. charge time
	b. schedule, availability
	c. service (battery cannot reach 0 while on route)
    4. costs
        a. energy 
	b. power
	c. rates
    5. dont' refer to Rocky Mountain Power, refer to 'billing utility'.  and UTA as the 'transit authority'
        a. billing utility
	    i. wants to delay infrastructure upgrades
	    ii. this is done by managing peak load
	b. transit authority
	    i. wants to minimize costs
problem formulation (to be included in the introduction):
1. buses, battery SOC, and routes
2. station, depot charges, availability
3. constraints
    a. charge time
    b. schedule and availability
    c. service (battery cannot reach 0 while on route)
4. costs
    a. uta: minimize fiscal costs associated with energy usage, power consumption, and time of day
    b. RMP: delay infrastructure upgrades by managing peak load
5. our approach ...
    a. uses directed graph to encode
        i. time -left to right layout of graph
	ii. bus availability - layers of nodes, or sets of nodes
	iii. charger - bus assignment - edges (binary var. on those edges)
	iv. charge rate (edges) 
	v. day vs night charging (connecting multiple graphs)
	vi. energy cost -> edges
	vii. nodes -> state of charge
	viii. talk about charge model
	ix. peak/off-peak/demand

6. move the list of contributions to the end of the literature review section
