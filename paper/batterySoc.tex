\section{Battery State of Charge}
1. remind how charging relates to the graph 
2. introduce $d_{i,j}$ and $g_{i,j}$ and show how they relate to the graph (picture for d for each node), (second picture for g for each charging timestep)
3. Charging
    a. Introduce variable rate charging -- make sure to mention this as a contribution
    b. Show how this adds edges to the graph (show picture)
4. Discharging
    a. Show how delta is incorporated
    b. mention that delta is taken from real data (contribution)
